# Pacman Project
This was my first MIT coding project of the class. I was given the task of creating the pacman image to bounce along the webpage without going off the screeen. I was able to create a functional tab to to start the game and add additional pacmen. 

## What I plan on improving
- I plan on more than one image that moves in the game.
- Would also like to different pacman images that change color when hit the walls.
