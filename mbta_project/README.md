# Mbta Bus Project
Had to create a live map on the bus routes between Mit and Harvard campus. Created a function and gathered data to move the busses between different locations on the map.

## How to get started 
- Clone files: index.html, eyes.js, and styles.css
- 
- Create an access token @ Mapbox.com   example: "mapboxgl.accessToken = 'your token';"
- Find a map layout that you would like to implement

## What i plan on improving
- add a 3d layout
- expand the routes
- mark when the bus is at full compacity
